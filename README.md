### Team Name: [skywalkers]


### Team Members

### Project Description
[[AURA FARMER is a completely unnecessary yet highly entertaining web app that scans your uploaded photo or webcam feed‚Ä¶ and assigns you a randomly generated ‚Äúaura score‚Äù with a flashy title and ridiculous tagline.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Society has been suffering for years from not knowing their true aura farmer ranking. How can anyone function without an arbitrary number telling them how awesome they are?]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We solved this non-issue by making a page that grabs your image, feeds it into absolutely no AI at all, and spits out a completely random aura score‚Äîbecause why let reality get in the way of good vibes]

## Technical Details

For Software:
- [Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript]

- [Frameworks: None (pure web magic)]

- [Libraries: None (handcrafted nonsense)]
